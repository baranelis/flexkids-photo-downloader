# flexkids-photo-downloader
A command line tool to download photos from flexkids website.

Recently Kindergarden (https://www.kindergarden.nl/) informed us that they are going to remove
old photos of the kids from their parents portal. (https://kindergarden.flexkids.nl/)

Since my daughter has been going to Kindergarden for more than 2 years there are hundreds of photos of her.

As a lazy person instead of downloading these photos using their website I decided to create a simple tool.

Usage of ./flexkids-photo-downloader:
  -password string
        password
  -url string
        url of the flexkids web site (default "https://kindergarden.flexkids.nl")
  -username string
        username
